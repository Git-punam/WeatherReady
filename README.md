# API Config

## For this application I have used OpenWeatherMap API (It's free)

go to <a src="https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys" target="_blank">HERE</a> to get your API KEY

## Once you have created your API key then follow these steps

- Create `.env` file in the root of the project
- copy `env var` from `.env-copy` and paste it into your `.env` file
- value of `.env var` should be your API key


## ***Your app all set***
